So he said: 'Do you not find among what Allah revealed to me: Respond to Allah and to the Messenger when they call you to what gives you life?' He said: 'Of course, I shall not repeat that, if Allah wills.' He said: 'Would you like for me to teach you a Surah the likes of which has neither been revealed in the Tawrah, nor the Injil, nor the Zabur, nor in the entire Qur'an?' He said: \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah!' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'What do you recite in your Salat?' He said: 'I recite Umm Al-Qur'an.'
