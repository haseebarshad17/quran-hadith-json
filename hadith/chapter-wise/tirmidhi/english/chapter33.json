So he said: 'What is wrong with you?'\" We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! You mentioned the Dajjal this morning, belittling him, and mentioning his importance until we thought that he might be amidst a cluster of the date-palms.' He said: 'It is not the Dajjal that I fear for you. If he were to appear while I am among you, then I will be his adversary on your behalf. And if he appears and I am not among you, then each man will have to fend for himself. And Allah will take care of every Muslim after me. He is young, with curly hair, his eyes protruding, resembling someone from 'Abdul-Uzza bin Qatan. Whoever among you sees him, then let him recite the beginning of Surah Ashab Al-Kahf.'\"He said: 'He will appear from what is between Ash-Sham and Al-'Iraq, causing devastation toward the right and toward the left. O worshippers of Allah! Hold fast!'\" We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! How long will he linger on the earth?' He said: 'Forty days, a day like a year, a day like a month, a day like a week, and the remainder of his days are like your days.'\" We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Do you think that during the day that is like a year, the Salat of one day will be sufficient for us?' He said: 'No. You will have to estimate it.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! How fast will he move through the earth.' He said: 'Like a rain storm driven by the wind. He will come upon a people and call them, and they will deny him, and reject his claims. Then he will leave them, and their wealth will follow him. They will awaken in the morning with nothing left. Then he will come upon a people and call them, and they will respond to him, believing in him. So he will order the Heavens to bring rain, and it shall rain, and he will order the land to sprout, and it will sprout. Their cattle will return to them with their coats the longest, their udders the fullest and their stomachs the fattest.' He said: 'Then he will come upon some ruins, saying to it: \"Bring me your treasures!\" He will turn to leave it, and it will follow him, like drone bees. Then he will call a young man, full of youth, and he will strike him with the sword cutting him into two pieces. Then he will call him, and he will come forward with his face beaming and laughing. So while he is doing that, 'Eisa bin Mariam, peace be upon him, will descend in eastern Damascus at the white minaret, between two Mahrud, with his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, drops fall, and when raises it, gems like pearls drop from him.' He said: 'His (the Dajjal's) breath does not reach anyone but he dies, and his breath reaches as far as his sight.' He said: 'So he pursues him(the Dajjal) and he catches up with him at the gate of Ludd where he kills him.' He said: 'So he remains there as long as Allah wills.' He said: 'Then Allah reveals to him: \"Take my slaves to At-Tur, for I have sent down some creatures of Mine which no one shall be able to kill.'\" He said: 'Allah dispatches Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and they are as Allah said: They swoop down from every mount.'\n\"He said: 'The first of them pass by the lake of Tiberias, drinking what is in it. Then the last of them pass by it saying: \"There was water here at one time.\" They travel until they reach a mountain at Bait Al-Maqdis. They will say: \"We have killed whoever was in the earth. Come! Let us kill whoever is in the skies.\" They will shoot their arrows into the Heavens, so Allah will return their arrows to them red with blood. Eisa bin Mariam and his Companions be surrounded, until the head of a bull on that day would be better to them than a hundred Dinar to one of you today.' \"He (s.a.w) said: \"Eisa will beseech Allah, as will his companions.' He said: 'So Allah will send An-Naghaf down upon their necks. In the morning they will find that they have all died like the death of a single soul.' He said: \" 'Eisa and his companions will come down, and no spot nor hand-span can be found, except that it is filled with their stench, decay and blood. So 'Eisa will beseech Allah, as will his companions.' So Allah will send upon them birds like the necks of Bukht(milch)camels.' They will carry them off and cast them into an abyss. The Muslims will burn their bows, arrows and quivers for seventy years.' \n\"He(s.a.w) said: 'Allah will send upon them a rain which no house of hide nor mud will bear. The earth will be washed, leaving it like a mirror. Then it will be said to the earth: \"bring forth your fruits and return your blessings.\" So on that day, a whole troop would eat a pomegranate and seek shade under its skin. Milk will be so blessed that a large group of people will be sufficed by one milking of a camel. And that a tribe will be sufficed by one milking of a cow, and that a group will be sufficed by the milking of sheep. While it is like that, Allah will send a wind which grabs the soul of every believer, leaving the remainder of the people copulating publicly like the copulation of donkeys. Upon them the Hour shall begin.'\"",
