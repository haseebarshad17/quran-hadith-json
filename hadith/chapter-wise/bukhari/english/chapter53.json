The time for the prayer \nbecame due but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not turn up; Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer but \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) did not turn up, so Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, \"The time for the prayer is due and \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) i detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"Yes, you wish.\" \nSo, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead the prayer), but the \nProphet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The people started clapping and \nthey clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither and thither in the prayer, but he turned \nround and saw the Prophet (ﷺ) standing behind him. The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned him with his hand to keep on \npraying where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came in \nthe (first) row, and the Prophet (ﷺ) went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet (ﷺ) \nfinished the prayer, he turned towards the people and said, \"O people! When something happens to \nyou during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women only. If \nsomething happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: 'Subhan Allah', (Glorified be Allah), for \nwhoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you \nfrom leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned to you (to continue)?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"It \ndid not befit the son of Abu Quhafa to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet.",
