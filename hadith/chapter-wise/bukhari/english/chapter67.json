      "english_text": "'Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) told him that there were four types of marriage during Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance. One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. \"Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him.\" Her husband would then keep away from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, \"You (all) know waht you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!\" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son. The man would not refuse all that. But when Muhammad (ﷺ) was sent with the Truth, he abolished all the types of marriages observed in pre-Islamic period of Ignorance except the type of marriage the people recognize today.",

      "english_text": "I had been eager to ask `Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two ladies from among the wives of the \nProphet regarding whom Allah said 'If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in \nrepentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes). (66.4) till \n`Umar performed the Hajj and I too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) `Umar went \naside to answer the call of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of \nwater, and when `Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and \nhe performed the ablution. Then I said to him, \"O chief of the Believers! Who were the two ladies \nfrom among the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) regarding whom Allah said: 'If you two (wives of the Prophet) \nturn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)?\" \n(66.4) \nHe said, \"I am astonished at your question, O Ibn `Abbas. They were `Aisha and Hafsa.\" Then `Umar \nwent on narrating the Hadith and said, \"I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid \nwho used to live in `Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet (ﷺ) in turn. He used to go one day and I \nanother day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the \nDivine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people \nof Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when we came to the Ansar, we found that \ntheir women had the upper hand over their men, so our women also started learning the ways of the \nAnsari women. I shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer \nme back. \nShe said to me, 'Why are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the \nProphet answer him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to) him throughout the day till \nthe night.' The (talk) scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever has done so will be ruined!' Then I \nproceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, 'Does anyone of you keep \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) angry till night?' She said, 'Yes.' I said, 'You are a ruined losing person! Don't you fear \nthat Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and thus you will be ruined? So do not ask \nmore from the Prophet (ﷺ) and do not answer him back and do not give up talking to him. Ask me \nwhatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e., `Aisha) in her manners for \nshe is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet (ﷺ) .\" `Umar added,\"At that time a talk \nwas circulating among us that (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. \nMy Ansari companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and \nknocked at my door violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He \nsaid, 'Today a great thing has happened.' I asked, 'What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan come?' He \nsaid, 'No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); has \ndivorced his wives. `Umar added, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) kept away from his wives and I said \"Hafsa is a \nruined loser.' I had already thought that most probably this (divorce) would happen in the near future. \nSo I dressed myself and offered the morning prayer with the Prophet (ﷺ) and then the Prophet; entered an \nupper room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, 'What \nmakes you weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet (ﷺ) divorce you all?' She said, 'I do not \nknow. There he is retired alone in the upper room.' I came out and sat near the pulpit and saw a group \nof people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not \nendure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet; was and said to a black slave of \nhis, 'Will you get the permission (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) for `Umar (to enter)?' The slave went in, talked to \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) about it and then returned saying, 'I have spoken to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned you but he \nkept quiet.' Then I returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not \nbear the situation and once again I said to the slave, 'Will you get the permission for `Umar?' He went \nin and returned saying, 'I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.' \nSo I returned again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the \nsituation, and so I went to the slave and said, 'Will you get the permission for `Umar?' He went in and \nreturned to me saying, 'I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.' When I was leaving, behold! The \nslave called me, saying, 'The Prophet (ﷺ) has given you permission.' \nThen I entered upon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm leaves \nand there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was leaning on \na leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing I said, 'O Allah's \nApostle! Have you divorced your wives?' He looked at me and said, 'No.' I said, 'Allah Akbar!' And \nthen, while still standing, I said chatting, 'Will you heed what I say, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? We, the people \nof Quraish used to have power over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the \nmen (here) were overpowered by their women.' The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled and then I said to him, 'Will you \nheed what I say, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? \nI entered upon Hafsa and said to her, \"Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (`Aisha), for she \nis more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' \" The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled for a second time. \nWhen I saw him smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I could not see \nanything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Invoke Allah to \nmake your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made prosperous and they have \nbeen given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not worship Allah.' \nThereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) sat up as he was reclining. and said, 'Are you of such an opinion, O the son of \nAl-Khattab? These are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in this world.' I \nsaid, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Ask Allah to forgive me.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) kept away from his wives for \ntwenty-nine days because of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to `Aisha. \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) had said, 'I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one month,' because of his anger \ntowards them, when Allah had admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet (ﷺ) \nfirst entered upon `Aisha. `Aisha said to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You had sworn that you would not \nenter upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting \nthem one by one.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'The (present) month is of twenty nine days.' `Aisha added, 'Then \nAllah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he asked me first, and I chose \nhim.' Then he gave option to his other wives and they said what `Aisha had said . \" (1) The Prophet, ' \nhad decided to abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed \nhim for doing so. Some of his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted \nthem for one month. See Qur'an: (66.4)",
