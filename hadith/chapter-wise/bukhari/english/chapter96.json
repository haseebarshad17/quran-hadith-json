And when we arrived (in Mecca) the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered us to finish the state \nof Ihram, saying, \"Finish your lhram and go to your wives (for sexual relation).\" Jabir added, \"The \nProphet did not oblige us (to go to our wives) but he only made that legal for us. Then he heard that \nwe were saying, \"When there remains only five days between us and the Day of `Arafat he orders us \nto finish our Ihram by sleeping with our wives in which case we will proceed to `Arafat with our male \norgans dribbling with semen?' (Jabir pointed out with his hand illustrating what he was saying). \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up and said, 'You (People) know that I am the most Allah-fearing, the most \ntruthful and the best doer of good deeds (pious) from among you. If I had not brought the Hadi with \nme, I would have finished my Ihram as you will do, so finish your Ihram. If I had formerly known \nwhat I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me.' So we finished our Ihram \nand listened to the Prophet (ﷺ) and obeyed him.\" (See Hadith No. 713, Vol. 2)",
