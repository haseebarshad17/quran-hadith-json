After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Allah's \nApostle and he said, \"Where are those Ash`ariyin? Where are those Ash`ariyin?\" So we went (to him) \nand he gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said \nto my companions, 'We went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would \nnot give us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nforgot his oath. By Allah, we will never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact that \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to remind him of his oath.' \nWe returned and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We came to you and asked you for mounts, but you took an \noath that you would not give us mounts) but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or \nconsidered that you have forgotten your oath.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Depart, for Allah has given you \nMounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I take an oath and then later find another thing better than that, I \ndo what is better, and make expiation for the oath.' \"\n\n(two other narrations through Zahdam as above)",
