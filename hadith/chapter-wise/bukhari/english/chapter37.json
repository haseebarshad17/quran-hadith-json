One day, by chance I was delayed, and I came late (at night) while they had slept. I \nmilked the sheep for them and took the milk to them, but I found them sleeping. I disliked to provide \nmy family with the milk before them. I waited for them and the bowl of milk was in my hand and I \nkept on waiting for them to get up till the day dawned. Then they got up and drank the milk. O Allah! \nIf I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from our critical situation caused by this rock.' So, \nthe rock shifted a little but they could not get out.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"The second man said, 'O Allah! I had a cousin who was the dearest of all people \nto me and I wanted to have sexual relations with her but she refused. Later she had a hard time in a \nfamine year and she came to me and I gave her one-hundred-and-twenty Dinars on the condition that \nshe would not resist my desire, and she agreed. When I was about to fulfill my desire, she said: It is \nillegal for you to outrage my chastity except by legitimate marriage. So, I thought it a sin to have \nsexual intercourse with her and left her though she was the dearest of all the people to me, and also I \nleft the gold I had given her. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from the \npresent calamity.' So, the rock shifted a little more but still they could not get out from there.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"Then the third man said, 'O Allah! I employed few laborers and I paid them their \nwages with the exception of one man who did not take his wages and went away. I invested his wages \nand I got much property thereby. (Then after some time) he came and said to me: O Allah's slave! Pay \nme my wages. I said to him: All the camels, cows, sheep and slaves you see, are yours. He said: O \nAllah's slave! Don't mock at me. I said: I am not mocking at you. So, he took all the herd and drove \nthem away and left nothing. O Allah!
