If I did this for Your sake only, kindly remove the rock so that \nwe could see the sky through it.' So, Allah removed the rock a little and they saw the sky. \nThe second man said, 'O Allah! I was in love with a cousin of mine like the deepest love a man may \nhave for a woman. I wanted to outrage her chastity but she refused unless I gave her one hundred \nDinars.
