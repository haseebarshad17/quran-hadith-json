My emigrant \nbrothers were busy in the market while I used to stick to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) content with what fills my \nstomach; so I used to be present when they were absent and I used to remember when they used to \nforget, and my Ansari brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the poor men of \nSuffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to forget. No doubt, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) once \nsaid, \"Whoever spreads his garment till I have finished my present speech and then gathers it to \nhimself, will remember whatever I will say.\" So, I spread my colored garment which I was wearing \ntill Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished his saying, and then I gathered it to my chest.

So, I struggled for it till I gathered the desired amount, and when I \nsat in between her legs, she told me to be afraid of Allah, and asked me not to deflower her except \nrightfully (by marriage). So, I got up and left her. O Allah! If You regard that I did if for Your sake, \nkindly remove this rock.' So, two-thirds of the rock was removed.
