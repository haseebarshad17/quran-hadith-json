So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Then he \ndid its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Allah to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamic \nera, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the Jews \nhad bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.",

The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), \"Did you sleep \n     with your wife last night?\" Abu Talha said, \"Yes\". The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \n     \"O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of \n     theirs.\" Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care\n     of the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the\n     child to the Prophet (ﷺ) and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with the \n     child. The Prophet (ﷺ) took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was \n     something with him. The people replied, \"Yes, a few dates.\" The \n     Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put \n     it into the child's mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named \n     him 'Abdullah.",
