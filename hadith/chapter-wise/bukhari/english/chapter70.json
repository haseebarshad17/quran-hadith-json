That year the land was not promising, so the payment \nof the debt was delayed one year. The Jew came to me at the time of plucking, but gathered nothing \nfrom my land. I asked him to give me one year respite, but he refused. This news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) \nwhereupon he said to his companions, \"Let us go and ask the Jew for respite for Jabir.\" All of them \ncame to me in my garden, and the Prophet (ﷺ) started speaking to the Jew, but he Jew said, \"O Abu \nQasim! I will not grant him respite.\" When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw the Jew's attitude, he stood up and walked \nall around the garden and came again and talked to the Jew, but the Jew refused his request. I got up \nand brought some ripe fresh dates and put it in front of the Prophet. He ate and then said to me, \n\"Where is your hut, O Jabir?\" I informed him, and he said, \"Spread out a bed for me in it.\" I spread \nout a bed, and he entered and slept. When he woke up, I brought some dates to him again and he ate of \nit and then got up and talked to the Jew again, but the Jew again refused his request. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) \ngot up for the second time amidst the palm trees loaded with fresh dates, and said, \"O Jabir! Pluck \ndates to repay your debt.\" The Jew remained with me while I was plucking the dates, till I paid him all \nhis right, yet there remained extra quantity of dates. So I went out and proceeded till I reached the \nProphet and informed him of the good news, whereupon he said, \"I testify that I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\"",
