Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith, and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the heaven. When Jibril reached the nearest heaven, he said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'who is it?' Jibril answered, 'Jibril'. He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Jibril replied, 'Muhammad (ﷺ) is with me.' He asked, 'Has he been called?', Jibril said, 'Yes'. So, the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven, and there we saw a man sitting with Aswida (a large number of people) of his right and Aswida on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked towards his left he wept. He said (to me), 'Welcome, O pious Prophet and pious son'. I said, 'Who is this man O Jibril?' Jibril replied, 'He is Adam, and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on the right are the people of Paradise, and those on the left are the people of the (Hell) Fire. So, when he looks to the right, he laughs, and when he looks to the left he weeps.' Then Jibril ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and said to the gatekeeper, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven has said, and he opened the gate.\"\n\nAnas added: Abu Dhar mentioned that Prophet (ﷺ) met Idris, Musa (Moses), 'Isa (Jesus) and Ibrahim (Abraham) over the heavens, but he did not specify their places (i.e., on which heavens each of them was), but he mentioned that he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) had met Adam on the nearest heaven, and Ibrahim on the sixth. Anas said, \"When Jibril and the Prophet (ﷺ) passed by Idris, the latter said, 'Welcome, O pious Prophet and pious brother!' the Prophet (ﷺ) asked, 'Who is he?' Jibril said, 'He is Idris.' \" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"Then I passed by Musa who said, 'Welcome, O pious Prophet  and pious brother!' I said, 'Who is he?' Jibril said, 'He is Musa.' Then I passed by 'Isa who said, 'Welcome, O pious Prophet and pious brother!' I said, 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is 'Isa.' Then I passed by the Prophet (ﷺ) Ibrahim who said, 'Welcome, O pious Prophet and pious son!' I said, 'Who is he?' Jibril replied, 'He is Ibrahim'.\"\n\nNarrated Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Haiyya Al-Ansari: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Then Jibril ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of pens.\" Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik state the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Allah enjoined fifty Salat (prayers) on me. When I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Musa who asked me, 'What has Allah enjoined on your followers?' I replied, 'He has enjoined fifty Salat (prayers) on them.' On the Musa said to me, 'Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction), for your followers will not be able to bear it.' So, I returned to my Lord and asked for some reduction, and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Musa again and informed him about it, he once more said to me, 'Go back to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it.' So, I returned to my Lord similarly as before, and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Musa and he said to me, 'Go back to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it.' I again returned to my Lord and He said, 'These are five (Salat-prayers) and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward), for My Word does not change.' I returned to Musa, he again told me to return to my Lord (for further reduction) but I said to him 'I feel shy of asking my Lord now.' Then Jibril took me till we reached Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e., lote tree of utmost boundary) which was shrouded in colors indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small tents (made) of pearls and its earth was musk (a kind of perfume).\"",

Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place \nnear the Ka`ba under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those \ndays there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed \nnear them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set \nout homeward. Ishmael's mother followed him saying, \"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us \nin this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to \nenjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, \n\"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and \nreturned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see \nhim, he faced the Ka`ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: \n'O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred \nHouse (Ka`ba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts \namong men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give \nthanks.' (14.37) Ishmael's mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). \nWhen the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became \nthirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not \nendure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that \nland. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she \ncould not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up \nher robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and \nreached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she \ncould not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa \nand Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself \nto be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, 'O, (whoever you may be)! \nYou have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an \nangel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that \nplace. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started \nfilling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped \nsome of it.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmael's mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow \nwithout trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam \nwould have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) further added, \"Then she \ndrank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, 'Don't be afraid of being neglected, for this \nis the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His \npeople.' The House (i.e. Ka`ba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when \ntorrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of \nJurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were \ncoming through the way of Kada'. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that \nhad the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, 'This bird must be flying around \nwater, though we know that there is no water in this valley.' They sent one or two messengers who \ndiscovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards \nthe water).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"Ishmael's mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, 'Do you \nallow us to stay with you?\" She replied, 'Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.' They \nagreed to that.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) further said, \"Ishmael's mother was pleased with the whole situation as \nshe used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for \ntheir families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents \nthere. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to \nlove and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a \nwoman from amongst them. \nAfter Ishmael's mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael's marriage in order to see his family \nthat he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael's wife about him, she \nreplied, 'He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Then he asked her about their way of living and their \ncondition, and she replied, 'We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,' \ncomplaining to him. He said, 'When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to \nchange the threshold of the gate (of his house).' When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt \nsomething unusual, so he asked his wife, 'Has anyone visited you?' She replied, 'Yes, an old man of \nso-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state \nof living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.' On that Ishmael said, 'Did he \nadvise you anything?' She replied, 'Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to \nchange the threshold of your gate.' Ishmael said, 'It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce \nyou. Go back to your family.' So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst \nthem (i.e. Jurhum). \nThen Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again \nbut did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael's wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, 'He has \ngone in search of our livelihood.' Abraham asked her, 'How are you getting on?' asking her about their \nsustenance and living. She replied, 'We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in \nabundance).' Then she thanked Allah' Abraham said, 'What kind of food do you eat?' She said. 'Meat.' \nHe said, 'What do you drink?' She said, 'Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The \nProphet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also \ninvoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his \nsustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) \nadded,\" Then Abraham said Ishmael's wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and \ntell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.' When Ishmael came back, he asked his \nwife, 'Did anyone call on you?' She replied, 'Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,' so she praised \nhim and added. 'He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told \nhim that we were in a good condition.' Ishmael asked her, 'Did he give you any piece of advice?' She \nsaid, 'Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of \nyour gate.' On that Ishmael said, 'It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has \nordered me to keep you with me.' \nThen Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them \nafterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw \nAbraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a \nson does with his father). Abraham said, 'O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.' Ishmael said, 'Do \nwhat your Lord has ordered you to do.' Abraham asked, 'Will you help me?' Ishmael said, 'I will help \nyou.' Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here,' pointing to a hillock higher than the \nland surrounding it.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the \nKa`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, \nIshmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while \nIshmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, 'O our Lord! Accept (this service) \nfrom us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.' The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"Then both of them \nwent on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord !

      "english_text": "When Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of her jealousy of Hajar, Ishmael's mother), \nhe took Ishmael and his mother and went away. They had a water-skin with them containing some \nwater, Ishmael's mother used to drink water from the water-skin so that her milk would increase for \nher child. When Abraham reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and afterwards returned home. \nIshmael's mother followed him, and when they reached Kada', she called him from behind, 'O \nAbraham! To whom are you leaving us?' He replied, '(I am leaving you) to Allah's (Care).' \nShe said, 'I am satisfied to be with Allah.' She returned to her place and started drinking water from \nthe water-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used up, she said to \nherself, 'I'd better go and look so that I may see somebody.' She ascended the Safa mountain and \nlooked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the valley, she ran till she \nreached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains) many times. They she \nsaid to herself, 'i'd better go and see the state of the child,' she went and found it in a state of one on \nthe point of dying. She could not endure to watch it dying and said (to herself), 'If I go and look, I may \nfind somebody.' \nShe went and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not find anybody. \nThus she completed seven rounds (of running) between Safa and Marwa. Again she said (to herself), \n'I'd better go back and see the state of the child.' But suddenly she heard a voice, and she said to that \nstrange voice, 'Help us if you can offer any help.' Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). \nGabriel hit the earth with his heel like this (Ibn `Abbas hit the earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and \nso the water gushed out. Ishmael's mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. \nthe Prophet) said, \"If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would have \nbeen flowing on the surface of the earth.\") Ishmael's mother started drinking from the water and her \nmilk increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe of Jurhum, while passing through \nthe bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that astonished them, and they said, 'Birds can only be \nfound at a place where there is water.' \nThey sent a messenger who searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform them about \nit. Then they all went to her and said, 'O ishmael's mother! Will you allow us to be with you (or dwell \nwith you)?' (And thus they stayed there.) Later on her boy reached the age of puberty and married a \nlady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham which he disclosed to his wife (Sarah), 'I want to \ncall on my dependents I left (at Mecca).' When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael's wife) and said, \n'Where is Ishmael?' She replied, 'He has gone out hunting.' Abraham said (to her), 'When he comes, \ntell him to change the threshold of his gate.' When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael \nsaid to her, 'You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).' Again Abraham \nthought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Mecca), and he told his wife (Sarah) of his \nintentions. \nAbraham came to Ishmael's house and asked. \"Where is Ishmael?\" Ishmael's wife replied, \"He has \ngone out hunting,\" and added, \"Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?' \nAbraham asked, 'What is your food and what is your drink?' She replied, 'Our food is meat and our \ndrink is water.' He said, 'O Allah! Bless their meals and their drink.\" Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e. Prophet) \nsaid, \"Because of Abraham's invocation there are blessings (in Mecca).\" Once more Abraham thought \nof visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and \nfound Ishmael behind the Zamzam well, mending his arrows. He said, \"O Ishmael, Your Lord has \nordered me to build a house for Him.\" Ishmael said, \"Obey (the order of) your Lord.\" \nAbraham said, \"Allah has also ordered me that you should help me therein.\" Ishmael said, \"Then I will \ndo.\" So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka`ba) while Ishmael went on handing \nhim the stones, and both of them were saying, \"O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, \nYou are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127). When the building became high and the old man \n(i.e. Abraham) could no longer lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over the stone of Al- \nMaqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, 'O our Lord! \nAccept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\" (2.127)",

So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, 'That was what \nwe were seeking after.' So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. \nThere they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, 'How \ndo people greet each other in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The man asked, 'Moses of Bani \nIsrael?' Moses said, 'Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah \nhas taught you.' He said, 'O Moses!

Moses asked, 'May I follow you?'

When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and \ndipped its beak once or twice into the sea. \nAl-Khadir said to Moses, 'O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's \nKnowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.' Then \nsuddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked \na plank with the adze. Moses said to him, 'What have you done? They took us on board charging us \nnothing; yet you I have intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, \nyou have done a dreadful thing.' Al-Khadir replied, 'Did I not tell you that you would not be able to \nremain patient with me?' Moses replied, 'Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be \nhard upon me for my fault.' So the first excuse of Moses was that he had forgotten. When they had left \nthe sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. \nAl-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator \npointed with his fingertips as if he was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, \"Have you killed an \ninnocent person who has not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.\" Al-Khadir \nsaid, \"Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me?' Moses said \"If I ask you about \nanything after this, don't accompany me. You have received an excuse from me.' Then both of them \nwent on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked its inhabitant for wood but they \nrefused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to collapse \n(and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with \nhis hands, illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said, \"These are \nthe people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests, yet \nyou have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it.\" Al-Khadir said, \n\"This is the parting between you and me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which \nyou could not remain patient.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"We wished that Moses could have remained \npatient by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the sub-narrator \nsaid that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he had remained patient, we \nwould have been told further about their case.\")",

He \nsaid (to himself), 'Shall I answer her or keep on praying?\" (He went on praying) and did not answer \nher, his mother said, \"O Allah! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.\" So while he was \nin his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and \npresented herself to him to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a \nchild and claimed that it belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his \nhermitage and expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer, \nand then came to the child and said, 'O child! Who is your father?' The child replied, 'The shepherd.' \n(After hearing this) the people said, 'We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold,' but he said, 'No, of \nnothing but mud.'(The third was the hero of the following story) A lady from Bani Israel was nursing \nher child at her breast when a handsome rider passed by her. She said, 'O Allah ! Make my child like \nhim.' On that the child left her breast, and facing the rider said, 'O Allah! Do not make me like him.' \nThe child then started to suck her breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, \"As if I were now looking at \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.\") After a while the people passed by, with a \nlady slave and she (i.e. the child's mother) said, 'O Allah! Do not make my child like this (slave girl)!, \nOn that the child left her breast and said, 'O Allah! Make me like her.' When she asked why, the child \nreplied, 'The rider is one of the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual \nintercourse.\"",

Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper, \nwent to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. \nSo none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such \nnice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give me a camel so that I may reach \nmy destination. The man replied, 'I have many obligations (so I cannot give you).' The angel said, 'I \nthink I know you; were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong aversion? Weren't you a poor \nman, and then Allah gave you (all this property).' He replied, '(This is all wrong), I got this property \nthrough inheritance from my fore-fathers.' The angel said, 'If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make \nyou as you were before. ' \nThen the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the bald man and said to \nhim the same as he told the first one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel \nsaid, 'If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were before.' \nThe angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said, 'I am a poor man and \na traveler, whose means of livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help \nme except Allah, and after Him, you yourself.

By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you need) of \nmy property which you may take for Allah's sake.'

So one of them said, 'O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who worked for me for one \nFaraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e. his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and \nwith its yield I bought cows (for him). Later on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to \nhim), 'Go to those cows and drive them away.' He said to me, 'But you have to pay me only a Faraq of \nrice,' I said to him, 'Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).' \nSo he drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove the \nrock.' The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. \nThe second one said, 'O Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk \nof my sheep every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and \nchildren were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my parents had \ndrunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should sleep without drinking it, \nI kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah! If You consider that I did that for fear of \nyou, then please remove the rock.' So the rock shifted and they could see the sky through it. The \n(third) one said, 'O Allah! You know that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle's daughter) who was \nmost beloved to me and I sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars \n(i.e. gold pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with \nher. But when I sat between her legs, she said, 'Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower me but legally. \n'I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider that I did that for fear of you \nthan please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they came out (of the cave).\"",
