A man praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, 'Umar said, 'In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in congregation!)'. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind Ubai bin Ka'b. Then on another night I went again in his company and the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, 'Umar remarked, 'What an excellent Bid'a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.' He meant the prayer in the last part of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of the night.\"",

In the morning, the people spoke about it and then a \nlarge number of them gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). In the next morning the \npeople again talked about it and on the third night the mosque was full with a large number of people. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) came out and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night the Mosque was \noverwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them, but the Prophet (ﷺ) came out (only) for the \nmorning prayer. When the morning prayer was finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the \npeople) said, \"Amma ba'du, your presence was not hidden from me but I was afraid lest the night \nprayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and you might not be able to carry it on.\" So, Allah's \nApostle died and the situation remained like that (i.e. people prayed individually). \"",
