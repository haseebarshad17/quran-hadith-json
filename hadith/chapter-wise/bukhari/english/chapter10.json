He said, \"You will see Allah (your Lord) in the same way. On the Day of \nResurrection, people will be gathered and He will order the people to follow what they used to \nworship. So some of them will follow the sun, some will follow the moon, and some will follow other \ndeities; and only this nation (Muslims) will be left with its hypocrites. Allah will come to them and \nsay, 'I am Your Lord.' They will say, 'We shall stay in this place till our Lord comes to us and when \nour Lord will come, we will recognize Him. Then Allah will come to them again and say, 'I am your \nLord.' They will say, 'You are our Lord.' Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid \nacross Hell and I (Muhammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers. \nNobody except the Apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then, 'O Allah!

The angels \nwill take them out by recognizing them from the traces of prostrations, for Allah has forbidden the \n(Hell) fire to eat away those traces. So they will come out of the Fire, it will eat away from the whole \nof the human body except the marks of the prostrations. At that time they will come out of the Fire as \nmere skeletons.

He \nwill be facing Hell, and will say, 'O Allah! Turn my face from the fire as its wind has dried me and its \nsteam has burnt me.' Allah will ask him, \"Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted \nto you?' He will say, \"No by Your (Honor) Power!\" And he will give to his Lord (Allah) what he will \nof the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face \nParadise and will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Allah will. He then will say, 'O my \nLord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.' Allah will ask him, 'Didn't you give pledges and make \ncovenants (to the effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you requested at first?' \nHe will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched, amongst Your creatures.' Allah will say, \n'If this request is granted, will you then ask for anything else?' He will say, 'No! By Your Power! I \nshall not ask for anything else.' Then he will give to his Lord what He will of the pledges and the \ncovenants. \nAllah will then let him go to the gate of Paradise.

How treacherous you are! \nHaven't you made covenants and given pledges that you will not ask for anything more that what you \nhave been given?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your \ncreatures.' So Allah will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and will ask him to request as much as \nhe likes. He will do so till all his desires have been fulfilled . Then Allah will say, 'Request more of \nsuch and such things.' Allah will remind him and when all his desires and wishes; have been fulfilled, \nAllah will say \"All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides.\" Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, said to \nAbu Huraira, 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Allah said, 'That is for you and ten times more like it.' \"Abu \nHuraira said, \"I do not remember from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) except (his saying), 'All this is granted to you \nand a similar amount besides.\" Abu Sa`id said, \"I heard him saying, 'That is for you and ten times \nmore the like of it.\"",

Then he stood up for prayer and I got up too \nand performed the ablution in the same way and joined him on his left side. He pulled me to the right \nand prayed as much as Allah will. Then he lay down and slept and I heard his breath sounds till the \nMu'adh-dhin came to him to inform him about the (Fajr) prayer. He left with him for the prayer and \nprayed without repeating the ablution. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said: We said to `Amr, \"Some people \nsay, 'The eyes of the Prophet (ﷺ) sleep but his heart never sleeps.' \" `Amr said, \"'Ubai bin `Umar said, 'The \ndreams of the Prophets are Divine Inspirations.
