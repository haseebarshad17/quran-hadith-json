The Prophet (ﷺ) further told us how that honesty will be taken \naway: He said: \"Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and only \nits trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which \nhonesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an ember \nis dropped on one's foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be \nnothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person. \nIt will be said, 'in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,' and later it will be said about some man, \n'What a wise, polite and strong man he is!' Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seed \nin his heart.\" No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with \nanyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and \nif he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I \ndo not deal except with such-and-such person.",
