      "english_text": "I got a she-camel in my share of the war booty on the day (of the battle) of Badr, and the Prophet (ﷺ) had \ngiven me a she-camel from the Khumus. When I intended to marry Fatima, the daughter of Allah's \nApostle, I had an appointment with a goldsmith from the tribe of Bani Qainuqa' to go with me to bring \nIdhkhir (i.e. grass of pleasant smell) and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its price on my wedding \nparty. I was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and ropes while my two shecamels \nwere kneeling down beside the room of an Ansari man. I returned after collecting whatever I \ncollected, to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their flanks cut open and some portion \nof their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I \nasked, \"Who has done this?\" The people replied, \"Hamza bin `Abdul Muttalib who is staying with \nsome Ansari drunks in this house.\" I went away till I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) and Zaid bin Haritha was \nwith him. The Prophet (ﷺ) noticed on my face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet (ﷺ) asked. \n\"What is wrong with you.\" I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have never seen such a day as today. \nHamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps, and ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting \nthere in a house in the company of some drunks.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked for his covering sheet, put it \non, and set out walking followed by me and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza \nwas. He asked permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) started \nrebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. Hamza looked at \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and then he raised his eyes, looking at his knees, then he raised up his eyes looking at \nhis umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at his face. Hamza then said, \"Aren't you but the \nslaves of my father?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) realized that he was drunk, so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) retreated, and we \nwent out with him.",

Abu Bakr said to her, \"Allah's \nApostle said, 'Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be \nused for charity).\" Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got angry and stopped speaking to Abu \nBakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the \ndeath of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). \nShe used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which he left at Khaibar, \nand Fadak, and his property at Medina (devoted for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that \nproperty and said, \"I will not leave anything Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do, because I am afraid that if I \nleft something from the Prophet's tradition, then I would go astray.\" (Later on) `Umar gave the \nProphet's property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to `Ali and `Abbas, but he withheld the properties of \nKhaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, \"These two properties are the Sadaqa which Allah's \nApostle used to use for his expenditures and urgent needs.

      "english_text": "While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the messenger of `Umar bin Al- \nKhattab came to me and said, \"The chief of the believers has sent for you.\" So, I went along with him \ntill I entered the place where `Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and covered \nwith no mattress, and he was leaning over a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, \"O \nMali! Some persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered that a gift \nshould be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.\" I said, \"O chief of the believers! I \nwish that you order someone else to do it.\" He said, \"O man! Take it.\" While I was sitting there with \nhim, his doorman Yarfa' came saying, \"`Uthman, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Az-Zubair and Sa`d bin \nAbi Waqqas are asking your permission (to see you); may I admit them?\" \n`Umar said, \"Yes\", So they were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After a while \nYarfa' came again and said, \"May I admit `Ali and `Abbas?\" `Umar said, \"yes.\" So, they were \nadmitted and they came in and greeted (him) and sat down. Then `Abbas said, \"O chief of the \nbelievers! Judge between me and this (i.e. `Ali).\" They had a dispute regarding the property of Bani \nAn-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai. The group (i.e. `Uthman and his companions) \nsaid, \"O chief of the believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them front each other.\" `Umar \nsaid, \"Be patient! I beseech you by Allah by Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do \nyou know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Our (i.e. prophets') property will not be inherited, and whatever \nwe leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),' and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) meant himself (by saying \"we'')?\" \nThe group said, \"He said so.\" `Umar then turned to `Ali and `Abbas and said, \"I beseech you by Allah, \ndo you know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said so?\" They replied, \" He said so.\" `Umar then said, \"So, I will \ntalk to you about this matter. Allah bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of something of this \nFai (booty) which he gave to nobody else.\" `Umar then recited the Holy Verses: \"What Allah \nbestowed as (Fai) Booty on his Apostle (Muhammad) from them --- for this you made no expedition \nwith either cavalry or camelry: But Allah gives power to His Apostles over whomever He will 'And \nAllah is able to do all things.\" 9:6) \n`Umar added \"So this property was especially given to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), but, by Allah, neither did he \ntake possession of it and leave your, nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it \nto all of you and distributed it amongst you till this property remained out of it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used \nto spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of its revenue \nto be spent on Allah 's Cause. Allah 's Apostle kept on doing this during all his lifetime. I ask you by \nAllah do you know this?\" They replies in the affirmative. `Umar then said to `Ali and `Abbas. \"I ask \nyou by Allah, do you know this?\" `Umar added, \"When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, 'Abu \nBakr said, 'I am the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it \nin the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and rightlyguided, \nand he was a follower of what was right. \nThen Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him and I became Abu Bakr's successor, and I kept that property in \nmy possession for the first two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nused to do and as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, \nand a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. 'Ah and `Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the \nsame claim and presenting the same case; you, `Abbas, came to me asking for your share from your \nnephew's property, and this man, i.e. `Ali, came to me asking for his wife's share from her father's \nproperty. I told you both that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Our (prophets') properties are not to be inherited, \nbut what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity).' \nWhen I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I said to you, 'I am ready to hand \nover this property to you if you wish, on the condition that you would take Allah's Pledge and \nConvention that you would manage it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to, and as Abu Bakr \nused to do, and as I have done since I was in charge of it.' So, both of you said (to me), 'Hand it over \nto us,' and on that condition I handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them \non this condition?\" The group aid, \"Yes.\" Then `Umar faced `Ali and `Abbas saying, \"I ask you by \nAllah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?\" They said, \"Yes. \" He said, \" Do you want now to \ngive a different decision? By Allah, by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never \ngive any decision other than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then \nreturn it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf.\"",

He said (to his men), \n'Some of you have stolen something from the booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a \npledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck over \nthe hand of their prophet. Then that prophet said (to the man), 'The theft has been committed by your \npeople.

      "english_text": "When Az-Zubair got up during the battle of Al-Jamal, he called me and I stood up beside him, and he \nsaid to me, \"O my son! Today one will be killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see \nthat I will be killed as an oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the \ndebts, there will be something left for us from our money?\" Az-Zubair added, \"O my son! Sell our \nproperty and pay my debts.\" Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and willed one-third of \nthat portion to his sons; namely, `Abdullah's sons. He said, \"One-third of the one third. If any property \nis left after the payment of the debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your \nsons.\" (Hisham, a sub-narrator added, \"Some of the sons of `Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of \nAz-Zubair e.g. Khubaib and `Abbas. `Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that time.\" (The \nnarrator `Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on drawing my attention to his debts saying, \n\"If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal to my Master to help you.\" By Allah! I could not \nunderstand what he meant till I asked, \"O father! Who is your Master?\" He replied, \"Allah (is my \nMaster).\" \nBy Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say, \"Master of Az-Zubair! Pay \nhis debts on his behalf .\" and Allah would (help me to) pay it. Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no \nDinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in \nMedina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed \nwas, that if somebody brought some money to deposit with him. Az-Zubair would say, \"No, (i won't \nkeep it as a trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.\" Az-Zubair was never \nappointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but he collected his \nwealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of the \nProphet, Abu Bakr, `Umar, and `Uthman. (`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, \nit turned to be two million and two hundred thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam \nmet `Abdullah bin Zubair and asked, \"O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?\" \n`Abdullah kept it as a secret and said, \"One hundred thousand,\" Hakim said, \"By Allah! I don't think \nyour property will cover it.\" On that `Abdullah said to him, \"What if it is two million and two hundred \nthousand?\" \nHakim said, \"I don't think you can pay it; so if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you.\" Az- \nZubair had already bought Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. `Abdullah sold it for one \nmillion and six hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, \"Any person who has any money \nclaim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba.\" There came to him `Abdullah bin Ja`far whom \nAz-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, \"If you wish I will \nforgive you the debt.\" `Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said, \"No.\" Then Ibn Ja`far said, \"If you wish you \ncan defer the payment if you should defer the payment of any debt.\" Ibn Az-Zubair said, \"No.\" \n`Abdullah bin Ja`far said, \"Give me a piece of the land.\" `Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to him), \n\"Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.\" So, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sold some of \nthe property (including the houses) and paid his debt perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from \nthe land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to Mu'awlya while `Amr bin `Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az- \nZubair and Ibn Zam`a were sitting with him. Mu'awiya asked, \"At what price have you appraised Al- \nGhaba?\" He said, \"One hundred thousand for each share,\" Muawiya asked, \"How many shares have \nbeen left?\" `Abdullah replied, \"Four and a half shares.\" \nAl-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" `Amr bin \n`Uthman said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Ibn Zam`a said, \"I would \nlike to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Muawiya said, \"How much is left now?\" `Abdullah \nreplied, \"One share and a half.\" Muawiya said, \"I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty \nthousand.\" `Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn AzZubair had \npaid all the debts. Az-Zubair's sons said to him, \"Distribute our inheritance among us.\" He said, \"No, \nby Allah, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, 'Would \nthose who have money claims on Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.\" So, he started \nto announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the \ninheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his property \nwas excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred \nthousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand.",

I followed `Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), \"What is wrong with the people \n(fleeing)?\" He replied, \"This is the Will of Allah,\" After the people returned, the Prophet (ﷺ) sat and said, \n\"Anyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will posses his spoils.\" I got up and said, \n\"Who will be a witness for me?\" and then sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) again said, \"Anyone who has killed \nan enemy and has proof of that, will possess his spoils.\" I (again) got up and said, \"Who will be a \nwitness for me?\" and sat down. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said the same for the third time. I again got up, and \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Abu Qatada! What is your story?\" Then I narrated the whole story to him. A \nman (got up and) said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man \nare with me. So please compensate him on my behalf.\" On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, \"No, by \nAllah, he (i.e. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of Allah's Lions \nwho fights on the behalf of Allah and His Apostle.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Abu Bakr has spoken the \ntruth.\" So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave the spoils to me. I sold that armor (i.e. the spoils) and with its price I \nbought a garden at Bani Salima, and this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to \nIslam.",
