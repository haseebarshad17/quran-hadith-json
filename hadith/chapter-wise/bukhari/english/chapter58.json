They stipulated that he would not stay for more than three days and would \nnot enter it except with sheathed arms and would not preach (Islam) to any of them. So `Ali bin Abi- \nTalib started writing the treaty between them. He wrote, \"This is what Muhammad, Apostle of Allah \nhas agreed to.\" The (Meccans) said, \"If we knew that you (Muhammad) are the Messenger of Allah, then \nwe would not have prevented you and would have followed you. But write, 'This is what Muhammad \nbin `Abdullah has agreed to..' \" On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"By Allah, I am Muhammad bin \n`Abdullah, and, by Allah, I am Apostle of 'Allah.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used not to write; so he asked `Ali \nto erase the expression of Apostle of Allah. On that `Ali said, \"By Allah I will never erase it.\" Allah's \nApostle said (to `Ali), \"Let me see the paper.\" When `Ali showed him the paper, the Prophet (ﷺ) erased \nthe expression with his own hand. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had entered Mecca and three days had \nelapsed, the Meccans came to `Ali and said, \"Let your friend (i.e. the Prophet) quit Mecca.\" `Ali \ninformed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Yes,\" and then he departed.",
