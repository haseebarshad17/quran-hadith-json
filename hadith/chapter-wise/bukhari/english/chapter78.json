'Think of such good (righteous) deeds which, you did for Allah's \nsake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to those deeds so that Allah may relieve you from \nyour difficulty. one of them said, 'O Allah! I had my parents who were very old and I had small \nchildren for whose sake I used to work as a shepherd. When I returned to them at night and milked \n(the sheep), I used to start giving the milk to my parents first before giving to my children. And one \nday I went far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), and didn't return home till late at \nnight and found that my parents had slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk \nvessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up from their sleep, and I also disliked to \ngive the milk to my children before my parents though my children were crying (from hunger) at my \nfeet. \nSo this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned. (O Allah!) If you considered that I had \ndone that only for seeking Your pleasure, then please let there be an opening through which we can \nsee the sky.' So Allah made for them an opening through which they could see the sky. Then the \nsecond person said, 'O Allah! I had a she-cousin whom I loved as much as a passionate man love a \nwoman. I tried to seduce her but she refused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars So I worked hard till I \ncollected one hundred Dinars and went to her with that But when I sat in between her legs (to have \nsexual intercourse with her), she said, 'O Allah's slave! Be afraid of Allah ! Do not deflower me \nexcept legally (by marriage contract). So I left her O Allah! If you considered that I had done that only \nfor seeking Your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a (wider) opening.' \nSo Allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them. And the last (third) person said 'O \nAllah ! I employed a laborer for wages equal to a Faraq (a certain measure: of rice, and when he had \nfinished his job he demanded his wages, but when I presented his due to him, he gave it up and \nrefused to take it. Then I kept on sowing that rice for him (several times) till managed to buy with the \nprice of the yield, some cows and their shepherd Later on the laborer came to me an said. '(O Allah's \nslave!) Be afraid o Allah, and do not be unjust to me an give me my due.' I said (to him). 'Go and take \nthose cows and their shepherd. So he took them and went away. (So, O Allah!) If You considered that \nI had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then please remove the remaining part of the rock.' And so \nAllah released them (from their difficulty).",

So when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and got \nhold of `Aisha and started requesting her to excuse him, and wept. Al-Miswar and `Abdur Rahman \nalso started requesting her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. \nThey said (to her), \"The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade what you know of deserting (not speaking to your Muslim \nBrethren), for it is unlawful for any Muslim not to talk to his brother for more than three nights \n(days).\" So when they increased their reminding her (of the superiority of having good relation with \nKith and kin, and of excusing others' sins), and brought her down to a critical situation, she started \nreminding them, and wept, saying, \"I have made a vow, and (the question of) vow is a difficult one.\" \nThey (Al-Miswar and `Abdur-Rahman) persisted in their appeal till she spoke with `Abdullah bin Az- \nZubair and she manumitted forty slaves as an expiation for her vow. Later on, whenever she \nremembered her vow, she used to weep so much that her veil used to become wet with her tears.",

He was visiting Sa`d bin 'Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith \nbin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed \nby a gathering in which `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before `Abdullah bin \nUbat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the \nMuslims there was `Abdullah bin Rawaha. \nWhen a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, `Abdullah bin \nUbai covered his nose with his garment and said, \"Do not cover us with dust.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) greeted \nthem, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the \nHoly Qur'an. On that `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, \"O man! There is nothing better than \nwhat you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to \nyou, you can preach to him.\" On that `Abdullah bin Rawaha said \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Call on us \nin our gathering, for we love that.\" So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one \nanother till they were about to fight with one another. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on quietening them till all \nof them became quiet, and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon \nSa`d bin 'Ubada. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Sa`d! Didn't you hear what Abu Habab said?\" (meaning \n`Abdullah bin Unbar). \"He said so-and-so.\" Sa`d bin Ubada said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Let my father be \nsacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the \nTruth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him \n(`Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler. \nSo when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that \ncaused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed.\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) excused \nhim. (It was the custom of) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of \nthe scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed \n(by them). Allah said: 'You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the \nScripture before you.....and from the pagans (3.186) \nHe also said: 'Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers \nafter you have believed. .... (2.109) So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to apply what Allah had ordered him by \nexcusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had fought the battle of \nBadr and Allah killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, \nand Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them \nsome of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. `Abdullah bin Ubai bin \nSalul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, \"This matter (Islam) has now brought out its \nface (triumphed), so give Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)\". Then they \nbecame Muslims.",
