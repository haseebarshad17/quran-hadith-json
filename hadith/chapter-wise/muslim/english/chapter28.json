He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with anything to ride. And it so happened that he was at that time much perturbed. I little knew of it, so I came back with a heavy heart on account of the refusal of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and the fear that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have some feelings against me. I returned to my friends and informed them about what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had said. I had hardly stayed for a little that I heard Bilal calling: 'Abdullah b. Qais. I responded to his call. He said: Hasten to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), he is calling you, When I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) he said: Take this pair, this pair, and this pair (i. e. six camels which he had bought from Sa'd), and take them to y, our friends and say: Verily Allah (or he said: Verily Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has provided you with these animals.

As we were about to go back, some of us said to the other: As we made Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forget oath, there would be no blessing for us (in his gift). We went back to him and said: Allah's Messenger, we came to you to provide us with riding animals and you took an oath that you would never equip us with mounts and then you have provided us with the riding beasts Allah's Messenger, have you forgotten? Thereupon he said: I swear by Allah that if Allah so wills, I shall not swear an oath, and then consider something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing the thing that is better.
