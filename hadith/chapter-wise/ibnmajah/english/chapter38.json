You\nare accountable for them in nothing,\nand they are accountable for you\nin nothing, that you may turn them\naway, and thus become of the\nunjust.” [6:52] Then he mentioned Aqra’\nbin Habis and ‘Uyaynah\nbin Hisn, then he said: “Thus We have tried\nsome of them with\nothers, that they might say: ‘Is it these (poor\nbelievers) whom\nAllah has favored from amongst us?’ Does not Allah\nknow best those\nwho are grateful.” [6:53] Then he said: “When those\nwho believe\nin Our Ayat come to you, say: Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be\non you);\nyour Lord has written (prescribed) mercy for Himself”.”\n[6:54] He\nsaid: “Then we got so close to him that our knees were\ntouching\nhis, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting with us.\nWhen he\nwanted to get up, he stood up and left us. Then Allah\nrevealed: “And\nkeep yourself patiently with those who call on their\nLord morning and\nafternoon, seeking His Face; and let not your eyes\noverlook them,”\n– and do not sit with the nobles – “desiring the pomp\nand\nglitter of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We\nhave made heedless of Our remembrance,” – meaning ‘Uyainah and\nAqra’ –\n“and who follows his own lusts, and those affair\n(deeds) has been\nlost” [18:28] He said: ‘May they be doomed.’\nHe said: ‘May ‘Uyainah\nand Aqra’ be doomed.’ Then he made the\nparable for them of two men and\nthe parable of this world. Khabbab\nsaid: “We used to sit with the\nProphet (ﷺ) and if the time came\nfor him to leave, we would get up\nand leave him, then he would\nleave.”",

Allah created you\nwith His Hand and His angels prostrated to you. Intercede for us with\nyour Lord, that He might grant us relief from our situation.’ He\nwill say: ‘I am not the one,’ and he will mention to them and\ncomplain of the sin that he committed. He will feel too shy to do\nthat (and will say): ‘Rather go to Nuh, for he is the first\nMessenger whom Allah sent to the people of earth.’ So they will go\nto him, but he will say: ‘I am not the one,’ and he will mention\nof how he asked of Allah that of which he had no knowledge.* He will\nfeel too shy to do that (and will say): ‘Rather go to the Close\nFriend of the Most Merciful, Ibrahim.’ So they will go to him and\nhe will say: ‘I am not the one. Rather go to Musa, a slave to whom\nAllah spoke and to whom He gave the Torah.’ So they will go to him\nand he will say: ‘I am not the one,’ and he will mention how he\nkilled a soul, not in retaliation for murder (and will say): ‘Rather\ngo to ‘Isa, the slave of Allah and His Messenger, the Word of Allah\nand a spirit created by Him.’ So they will go to him, but he will\nsay: ‘I am not the one. Rather go to Muhammad, a slave whose past\nand future sins Allah forgave.’ So they will come to me and I will\ngo with them.” – There was a similar report from Hasan who added\n(the Prophet (ﷺ) said:) And I will walk between two rows of the\nbelievers.” Then he went back to the Hadith of Anas. – And he\nsaid: “And I will ask my Lord for permission and permission will be\ngiven to me. When I see Him I will fall down prostrating, and I will\nbe left as long as Allah wills to leave me. Then it will be said:\n‘Get up, O Muhammad.

Then they will be admitted to Paradise, and\nI will come back a second time. When I see Him I will fall down\nprostrating, and I will be left as long as Allah wills to leave me.\nThen it will be said: ‘Get up, O Muhammad. Speak, you will be\nheard; ask, you will be given; intercede, your intercession will be\naccepted.’ I will praise Him with praise that He will teach me,\nthen I will intercede, and a limit will be set. Then they will be\nadmitted to Paradise, and I will come back a third time. When I see\nHim I will fall down prostrating, and I will be left as long as Allah\nwills to leave me. Then it will be said: ‘Get up, O Muhammad.\nSpeak, you will be heard; ask, you will be given; intercede, your\nintercession will be accepted.’ I will praise Him with praise that\nHe will teach me, then I will intercede, and a limit will be set.\nThen they will be admitted to Paradise, and I will come back a fourth\ntime and will say: ‘O Lord, there is no one left except those who\nare detained by the Qur’an.’” **\n\nQatadah (the Tabi'ee in the chain) would narrate after this hadith that Anas (ra) said \"Those who said 'La illaha illa Allah' (there is no god except Allah) and had the weight of a grain of barley in good in his heart will come out of the Fire, and those who said 'La illaha illa Allah' and had a weight of a grain of wheat in good in his heart will come out of the Fire, and those who said 'La illaha illa Allah' and had a weight of a grain of dust in good in his heart will come out of the Fire.\"",

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told me that when the\npeople of Paradise enter it, they will take their places according to\ntheir deeds, and they will be given permission for a length of time\nequivalent to Friday on earth, when they will visit Allah. His Throne\nwill be shown to them and He will appear to them in one of the\ngardens of Paradise. Chairs of light and chairs of pearls and chairs\nof rubies and chairs of chrysolite and chairs of gold and chairs of\nsilver will be placed for them. Those who are of a lower status than\nthem, and none of them will be regarded as insignificant, will sit on\nsandhills of musk and camphor, and they will not feel that those who\nare sitting on chairs are seated better than them.”\n\nAbu Hurairah said: “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord?’ He said: ‘Yes. Do you dispute that you see the sun and the moon on the night when it is full?’ We said: ‘No.’ He said: ‘Likewise, you will not dispute that you see your Lord, the Glorified. There will be no one left in that gathering with whom Allah does not speak face to face, until He will say to a man among you: “Do you not remember, O so-and-so, the day you did such and such?” And He will remind him of some of his sins in this world. He will say: “O Lord, have You not forgiven me?” He will say: “Yes, it is by the vastness of My forgiveness that You have reached the position you are in.” While they are like that, a cloud will cover them from above and will rain down on them perfume the like of whose fragrance they have never smelled before. Then He will say: “Get up and go to the honor that has been prepared for you, and take whatever you desire.” So we will go to a marketplace surrounded by the angels, in which there will be such things as eyes have never seen, ears have never heard and it has not entered the heart of man. Whatever we desire will be carried for us. Nothing will be bought or sold therein. In that marketplace the people of Paradise will meet one another. A man of elevated status will meet those who are of lower status than him, but none shall be regarded as insignificant, and he will be dazzled by the clothes that he sees on him. He will not finish the last of his conversation before better clothes appear on him. That is because no one should be sad there.’”\n“He said: ‘Then we will go back to our homes where we will be met by our wives, and they will say: ‘Welcome. You have come looking more handsome and with a better fragrance than when you left us.’ And we will say: ‘Today we sat with our Lord, the Compeller, the Glorified, and we deserve to come back as we have come back.’”",
