Invite\nthem to accept Islam, and if they respond then accept it\nfrom them and\nrefrain from fighting them. Then invite them to leave\ntheir land and\nmove to the land of the polytheists.

When believing women\ncome to you to give you the pledge...’”[60:12]\n\n‘Aishah said: “Whoever among the believing women affirmed this, passed the test. When they affirmed that, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would say to them: ‘Go, for you have given your pledge.’ No, by Allah! The hand of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never touched the hand of any woman, rather he accepted their pledge in words only.”\n‘Aishah said: “By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not demand of women (in their pledge) anything other than that which Allah had commanded, and the hand of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never touched the hand of a woman. He would say to them, when he had accepted their pledge: ‘You have given your pledge,’ verbally.”",
