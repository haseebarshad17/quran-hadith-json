By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has indeed\ndied.’ ‘Umar\nwas in a corner of the mosque saying: ‘By Allah,\nthe Messenger of\nAllah (ﷺ) has not died and he will never die until\nthe hands and\nfeet of most of the hypocrites are cut off.’ Then Abu\nBakr stood up,\nascended the pulpit and said: ‘Whoever used to\nworship Allah, Allah is\nalive and will never die. Whoever used to\nworship Muhammad, Muhammad\nis dead. “Muhammad is no more than a\nMessenger, and indeed (many)\nMessengers have passed away before him.\nIf he dies or is killed, will\nyou then turn back on your heels (as\ndisbelievers)?

They sent\ntwo\nmessengers to both of them, and they said: ‘O Allah, choose\nwhat is\nbest for Your Messenger.’ They found Abu Talhah and brought\nhim, but\nthey did not find Abu ‘Ubaidah. So he dug a grave with a\nniche for the\nMessenger of Allah (ﷺ). When they had finished\npreparing him, on\nTuesday, he was placed on his bed in his house.\nThen the people\nentered upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in groups\nand offered the\nfuneral prayer for him, and when they finished the\nwomen entered, and\nwhen they finished the children entered, and no\none led the people in\noffering the funeral prayer for the Messenger\nof Allah (ﷺ). The\nMuslims differed concerning the place where he\nshould be buried. Some\nsaid that he should be buried in his mosque.\nOthers said that he\nshould be buried with his Companions. Then Abu\nBakr said: ‘I heard the\nMessenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “No Prophet\never passed away but he was\nburied where he died.” So they lifted\nup the bed of the Messenger of\nAllah (ﷺ) on which he had died, and\ndug the grave for him, then he\n(ﷺ) was buried in the middle of\nTuesday night. ‘Ali bin Abu Talib,\nFadl bin ‘Abbas and his\nbrother Qutham, and Shuqran the freed slave of\nthe Messenger of Allah\n(ﷺ) went down in his grave. Aws bin Khawli,\nwho was Abu Laila, said\nto ‘Ali bin Abi Talib: ‘I adjure you by Allah!\nGive us our share\nof the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ So ‘Ali said to\nhim: ‘Come\ndown.’ Shuqran, his freed slave, had taken a Qatifah which\nthe\nMessenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to wear. He buried it in his grave\nand\nsaid, ‘By Allah, no one will ever wear it after you.’ So it was\nburied with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).”",
