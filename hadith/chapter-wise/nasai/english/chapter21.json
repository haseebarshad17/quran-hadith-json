      "english_text": "\"When the Prophet of Allah sat, some of his  Companions would sit with him. Among them was a man who had a little son who used to come to him from behind, and he would make him sit in front of him. He (the child) died, and the man stopped attending the circle because it reminded him of his son, and made him feel sad. The Prophet missed him and said: 'Why do I not see so-and-so?' They said: O Messenger of Allah, his son whom you saw has died.' The Prophet met him and asked him about his son, and he told him that he had died. He offered his condolences and said: 'O son-and-so, which would you like better, to enjoy his company all you life, or to come to any of the gates of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection, and find that he arrived there before you, and he is opening the gate for you?' he said: 'O Prophet of Allah! For him to get to the gate of Paradise before me and open it for me is dearer to me.' He said: 'You will have that.\"'",
