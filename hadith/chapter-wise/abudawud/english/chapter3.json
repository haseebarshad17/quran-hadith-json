Allah has ordered you to supplicate Him has and promised that He will answer your prayer.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThen he said: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the Master of the Day of Judgment. There is no god but Allah Who does what He wishes. O Allah, Thou art Allah, there is no deity but Thou, the Rich, while we are the poor.
