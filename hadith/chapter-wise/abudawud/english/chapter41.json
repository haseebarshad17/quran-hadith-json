But if a man of an-Nadir killed a man of Qurayzah, a hundred wasq of dates would be paid as blood-money. When Prophethood was bestowed upon the Prophet (ﷺ), a man of an-Nadir killed a man of Qurayzah.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThey said: Give him to us, we shall kill him.  They replied: We have the Prophet (ﷺ) between you and us. So they came to him.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThereupon the following verse was revealed: \"If thou judge, judge in equity between them.\" \"In equity\" means life for a life.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe following verse was then revealed: \"Do they seek of a judgment of (the days) ignorance?\"\n\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Quraizah and al-Nadir were the descendants of Harun the Prophet (peace be upon him)",

Uyaynah spoke about the killing of al-Ashja'i, for he belonged to Ghatafan, and al-Aqra' ibn Habis spoke on behalf of Muhallam, for he belonged to Khunduf. The voices rose high, and the dispute and noise grew.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSo the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you not accept blood-money, Uyaynah?  \n\n\n\n\n\nUyaynah then said: No, I swear by Allah, until I cause his women to suffer the same fighting and grief as he caused my women to suffer. Again the voices rose high, and the dispute and noise grew.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do you not accept the blood-money Uyaynah? Uyaynah gave the same reply as before, and a man of Banu Layth called Mukaytil stood up. He had a weapon and a skin shield in his hand.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: I do not find in the beginning of Islam any illustration for what he has done except the one that \"some sheep came on, and those in the front were shot; hence those in the rear ran away\". (The other example is that) \"make a law today and change it.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Fifty (camels) here immediately and fifty when we return to Medina. This happened during some of his journeys. Muhallam was a tall man of dark complexion. He was with the people. They continued (to make effort for him) until he was released. He sat before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), with his eyes flowing.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: Messenger of Allah! I have done (the act) of which you have been informed. I repent to Allah, the Exalted, so ask Allah's forgiveness for me. Messenger of Allah!  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: Did you kill him with your weapon at the beginning of Islam. O Allah! do not forgive Muhallam. He said these words loudly.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAbuSalamah added: He (Muhallam) then got up while he was wiping his tears with the end of his garment.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIbn Ishaq said: His people alleged that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked forgiveness for him after that.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Al-Nadr b.

'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl and Huwayyasah and Muhayyasah, the sons of his uncle (Mas'ud) came to the Prophet (ﷺ). 'Abd al-Rahman, who was the youngest, spoke about his brother, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: (Respect) the elder, (respect) the elder or he said: Let the eldest begin. They then spoke about their friend and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Fifty of you should take oaths regarding a man from them (the Jews) and he should be entrusted (to him) with his rope (in his neck). They said: It is a matter which we did not see. How can we take oaths ? He said: The Jews exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them. They said: Messenger of Allah! they are a people who are infidels. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) paid them bloodwit himself. Sahl said: Once I entered the resting place of their camels, and the she-camel struck me with her lef. Hammad said this or (something) similar to it.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Another version transmitted by Yahya b.

'Abdah transmitted it from Yahya as transmitted by Hammad.

He did not mention the claim.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn 'Uyainah.",

So when they were dear, he increased the amount to be paid, and when cheap prices prevailed he reduced the amount to be paid. In the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) they reached between four hundred and eight hundred dinars, their equivalent in silver being eight thousand dirhams.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that those who possessed cattle should pay two hundred cows, and those who possessed sheep two thousand sheep.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The blood-money is to be treated as something to be inherited by the heirs of the one who has been killed, and the remainder should be divided among the agnates.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that for cutting off a nose completely there was full blood-money, one hundred (camels) were to be paid. If the tip of the nose was cut off, half of the blood-money,i.e. fifty camels were to be paid, or their equivalent in gold or in silver, or a hundred cows, or one thousand sheep. For the hand, when it was cut of,f half of the blood-money was to be paid; for one foot of half, the blood-money was to be paid. For a wound in the head, a third of the blood-money was due, i.e. thirty-three camels and a third of the blood-money, or their equivalent in gold, silver, cows or sheep. For a head thrust which reaches the body, the same blood-money was to be paid. Ten camels were to be paid for every finger, and five camels for every tooth.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave judgment that the blood-money for a woman should be divided among her relatives on her father's side, who did not inherit anything from her except the residence of her heirs. If she was killed, her blood-money should be distributed among her heirs, and they would have the right of taking revenge on the murderer.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is nothing for the murderer; and if he (the victim) has no heir, his heir will be the one who is nearest to him among the people, but the murderer should not inherit anything.  \n\n\n\n\n\nMuhammad said: All this has been transmitted to me by Sulayman ibn Musa on the authority of Amr ibn Shu'aib who, on his father's authority, said that his grandfather heard it from the Prophet (ﷺ).\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Muhammad b.
