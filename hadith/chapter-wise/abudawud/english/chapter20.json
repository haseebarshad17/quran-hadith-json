He asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam, and they embraced Islam. He divided the camels among them. But it occurred to him then that he should withdraw his camels from them. Is he more entitled to them or we? If he says: Yes or no, then tell him: My father is an old man, and he is the chief of the people living at the water. He has requested you to make me chief after him.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe came to him and said: My father has extended his greetings to you.  He replied: On you and you father be peace.  He said: My father asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam. So they embraced Islam, and their belief in Islam is good. Then it occurred to him that he should take his camels back from them. Is he more entitled to them or are they?  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: If he likes to give them the camels, he may give them; and if he likes to take them back, he is more entitled to them than his people. If they embraced Islam, then for them is their Islam. If they do not embrace Islam, they will be fought against in the cause of Islam.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: My father is an old man; he is the chief of the people living at the spring.

'Affan, 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, al-Zubair b. al-'Awwam, and Sa'd b, Abi Waqqas (to enter) ? He said:  Yes. So he permitted them and they entered. Yarfa' again came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, would you permit al-'Abbas and 'Ali ? He said: Yes. He then permitted them and they entered. Al-'Abbas said: Commander of Faithful, decide between me and this, referring to 'Ali. Some of them said: Yes, Commander of the Faithful, decide between them and give them comfort. Malik b. Aws said: It occurred to me that both of them brought the other people for this. 'Umar said: Show patience (do not make haste). He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then said: Allah has appointed for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) a special portion (in the booty) which he did not do for anyone. Allah, Most High, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His apostles over any He pleases ; and Allah has power over all things\". Allah bestowed (the property of) Banu al-Nadir on His Apostle. I swear by Allah, he did not reserve it for himself, nor did he take it over and above you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to his share for his maintenance annually, or used to take his contribution and give his family their annual contribution (from this property), then take what remained and deal with it as he did with Allah's property. He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes.  He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  died, Abu Bakr said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then you and this ('Ali) came to Abu Bakr, demanding a share from the inheritance of your cousin, and this ('Ali) demanding the share of his wife from (the property of her) father. Abu Bakr then said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah. Allah knows that he (Abu Bakr) was true, faithful, rightly-guided, and the follower of Triuth. Abu Bakr then administered it (property of the Prophet). When Abu Bakr died, I said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr. So I administered whatever Allah wished. Then you and this ('Ali) came. Both of you are at one, and your matter is the same. So they asked me for it (property), and I said: If you wish I give it to you on condition that you are bound by the covenant of Allah, meaning that you will administer it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  used to administer. So you took it from me on that condition. Then again you have come to me so that I decide between you other than that. I swear by Allah, I shall not decide between you other than that till the Last Hour comes. If you helpless, return it to me.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: They asked him for making it half between them, and not that they were ignorant of the fact the Prophet (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They were also seeking the truth. 'Umar then said: I do not apply the name of division to it ; It leave it on its former condition.",

Messenger of Allah, you are the kindest of the people and the most skilled in matchmaking. Our fathers have nothing with which to pay our dower. So appoint us collector of sadaqah (zakat), Messenger of Allah, and we shall give you what the other collectors give you, and we shall have the benefit accruing from it. Ali came to us while we were in this condition.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No, I swear by Allah, he will not appoint any of you collector of sadaqah (zakat).  \n\n\n\n\n\nRabi'ah said to him: This is your condition; you have gained your relationship with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) by marriage, but we did not grudge you that. Ali then put his cloak on the earth and lay on it.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe then said: I am the father of Hasan, the chief. I swear by Allah, I shall not leave this place until your sons come with a reply (to the question) for which you have sent them to the Prophet (ﷺ).  \n\n\n\n\n\nAbdulMuttalib said: So I and al-Fadl went towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (ﷺ). We found that the noon prayer in congregation had already started. So we prayed along with the people. I and al-Fadl then hastened towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (ﷺ). He was (staying) with Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, that day. We stood until the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came. He caught my ear and the ear of al-Fadl.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe then said: Reveal what you conceal in your hearts. He then entered  and permitted me and al-Fadl (to enter). So we entered and for a little while we asked each other to talk. I then talked to him, or al-Fadl talked to him (the narrator, Abdullah was not sure).  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: He spoke to him concerning the matter about which our fathers ordered us to ask him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent for a moment and raised his eyes towards the ceiling of the room. He took so long that we thought he would not give any reply to us. Meanwhile we saw that Zaynab was signalling to us with her hand from behind the veil, asking us not to be in a hurry, and that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was (thinking) about our matter.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then lowered his head and said to us: This sadaqah (zakat) is a dirt of the people. It is legal neither for Muhammad nor for the family of Muhammad. Call Nawfal ibn al-Harith to me. So Nawfal ibn al-Harith was called to him.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: Nawfal, marry AbdulMuttalib (to your daughter). So Nawfal married me (to his daughter).  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) then said: Call Mahmiyyah ibn Jaz'i to me. He was a man of Banu Zubayd, whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had appointed collector of the fifths.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Mahmiyyah: Marry al-Fadl (to your daughter).

The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) also gave me an old she camel from the fifth that day. When I intended to cohabit with Fathimah daughter of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I made arrangement with a man who was a goldsmith belonging to Banu Qainuqa’ to go with me so that we may bring grass. I intended to sell it to the goldsmith there by seeking help in my wedding feast. While I was collecting for my old Camels saddles, baskets and ropes both of she Camels were seated in a corner of the apartment of a man of the Ansar. When I collected what I collected (i.e., equipment) I turned (towards them). I suddenly found that the humps of she Camels were cut off and their hips were pierced and their lives were taken out. I could not control my eyes (to weep) when I saw that scene. I said “Who has done this?” They (the people) replied “Hamzah bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib”. He is among the drunkards of the Ansar in this house. A singing girl is singing for him and his Companions. While singing she said “Oh Hamza, rise to these plumpy old she Camels. So he jumped to the sword and cut off their humps, pierced their hips and took out their livers.” ‘Ali said “I went till I entered upon the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) while Zaid bin Harithah was with him.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) realized what I had met with. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) aid “What is the matter with you?” I said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I never saw the thing that happened with me today. Hamzah wronged my she Camels, he cut off their humps, pierced their hips. Lo! He is in a house with drunkards. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) asked for his cloak. It was brought to him. He then went out, I and Zaid bin Harithah followed him until we reached the house where Hamzah was. He asked permission ( to entre). He was permitted. He found drunkards there. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) began to rebuke him (Hamzah) for his action. Hamzah was intoxicated and his eyes were reddish. Hamzah looked at the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). He then raised his eyes and looked at his knees, he then raised his eyes and looked at his navel and he then raised his eyes and looked at his face. Hamzah then said “Are you but the salves of my father? Then the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) knew that he was intoxicated. So the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) moved backward. He then went out and we also went out with him.”",

They cannot contrive a plot against you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this from the Prophet (ﷺ), they scattered. This reached the infidels of the Quraysh.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe infidels of the Quraysh again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter reached the Prophet (ﷺ), they gathered Banu an-Nadir to violate the treaty.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThey sent a message to the Prophet (ﷺ): Come out to us with thirty men from your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator then narrated the whole story.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the next day came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out in the morning with an army, and surrounded them.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe told them: I swear by Allah, you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with me.

      "english_text": "I met Bilal, the Mu'adhdhin of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at Aleppo, and said: Bilal, tell me, what was the financial position of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and feed him.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body of merchants.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian.  I said: I am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said harsh words to me.  He asked me: Do you know how many days remain in the completion of this month?  I replied: The time is near.  He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned to his family. I sought permission from him and he gave me permission.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI said: Messenger of Allah, may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (ﷺ) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I intended to be on my way.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAll of a sudden I saw a man running towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So I went till I reached him. I found four mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought permission.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling on the ground?  \n\n\n\n\n\nI replied: Yes.  He said: You may have these mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and pay off your debt. I did so.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe then mentioned the rest of the tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting there. I greeted him.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe asked: What benefit did you have from your property?  I replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Nothing remains now.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe asked: Did anything remain (from that property)?  I said: Yes.  He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some comfort from it. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)?  \n\n\n\n\n\nI said: I still have it, no one came to me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed the night in the mosque.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe then narrated the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)?  \n\n\n\n\n\nI replied: Allah has given you comfort from it, Messenger of Allah.  He said: Allah is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die while it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his wives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his place where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you asked me.",

My companion, Hurayth ibn Hassan, came to him as a delegate from Bakr ibn Wa'il. He took the oath of allegiance of Islam for himself and for his people. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe then said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), write a document for us, giving us the land lying between us and Banu Tamim at ad-Dahna' to the effect that not one of them will cross it in our direction except a traveller or a passer-by.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: Write down ad-Dahna' for them, boy. When I saw that he passed orders to give it to him, I became anxious, for it was my native land and my home.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI said: Messenger of Allah, he did not ask you for a true border when he asked you. This land of Dahna' is a place where the camels have their home, and it is a pasture for the sheep. The women of Banu Tamim and their children are beyond it.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: Stop, boy! A poor woman spoke the truth: a Muslim is a brother of a Muslim. Each one of them may benefit from water and trees, and they should cooperate with each other against Satan.",
